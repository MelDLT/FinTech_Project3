# Automative Trader
The concept for this project is to create a trading algorithm that can be used on stocks and cryptocurrency exchanges. The algorithm will pull data using alpaca API and kraken cryptocurrency API. The data from the API will be used to develop the algorithm which will be based on signal compilation. The compiled signals will include SMA, Bolinger Bands, and MACD. The produced signal functions will be backtested on historical data to show if triggers appear at appropriate points in the past market prices. The API will then be hooked up and connected to a paper trade account to execute trades based on trading signals triggered in the algorithm. The main price data used for the signals will be daily closing price. This will make the timescale a daily period for signals to occur. The algorithm should be suitable for day trading.
